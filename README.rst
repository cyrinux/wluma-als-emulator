Ambient Light Sensor Emulator for `wluma <https://github.com/maximbaz/wluma>`__
===============================================================================

DEPRECATED
==========

* Main goal is this project was ported in wluma itself under the config `als.webcam`, See `wluma 3.0.0 <https://github.com/maximbaz/wluma/releases/tag/3.0.0>`__.


This is a fake ambient light sensor for those who donâ€™t get one built
into in their laptop.

Mainly done for `wluma <https://github.com/maximbaz/wluma>`__ and based
on `@maximbaz <https://github.com/maximbaz>`__'s work. ``wluma`` is a
great project that sets screen brighness based on screen contents and
ambient light around you.

The following modes are available:

-  ``webcam``: takes a webcam capture with ffmpeg and approximates
   ambient light value out of image brightness.
-  ``time``: approximates ambient light value based on the current time, all the day.
-  ``noon``: approximates ambient light value based on the current time with the noon as reference.
-  ``daylight``: approximates ambient light value based on the solar phases, twilight.
